                <p class="future_paragraph2">However, I'd like to focus in the front-end and design of the web pages or applications, but also want to be a full-stack programmer, as I think that is getting more popular in the computing field. Also, it is valuable to understand how the front-end and back-end can run as a whole system, which will require me to learn more about other programing languages, such as node.js and c#.</p>
                <p class="future_paragraph3">Moreover, I'm also interested in the developing of Web3, which lead to the big topic of decentralisation. Thus, I'll like to keep going with my self-learning plans, and getting to know more about the future path of computing, and also the basic knowledge of computing science.</p>
