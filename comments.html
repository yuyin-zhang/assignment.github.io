                        The HTML files create the framework and layout of the website, which is using the div (an HTML element); 
                        div is the content division element, which allows me to group similar sets of content together on the web page as it is the generic container for flow content in HTML.

                    <p class="technical_aspects_p2">
                        There are four main div tags in each webpage of this website (might be more div tags in some HTML files which are under the main ones), which include: menu_bar, title, main and footer. 
                        They are all tagged using 'id' to specify a unique id for an HTML element. These elements are listed below:
                    </p>

                        contains the navigation links to the individual webpages in this website, which allows everyone who opens this website can access the all the webpages.
                        The links include all four webpages in this website, and three of them are displayed on the top of each webpage, except the one is showing on the page. For example, the HOME, PAST and FUTURE links are displayed on the top of the COMMENTS page.
                        They created using the a tag, which is referring to the Hyperlinks in HTML elements. They are created using unordered list and linking to the CSS file with 'display: inline;' and 'padding: 200px;', so that they are displayed in a horizontal line with equal space between them.

                        contains the main title / header of the page. This is created using the h1 tag, which is customised by the .header class in the CSS file.

                        contains the main contents of the page. 
                        This included few smaller titles in the page which are created using a mixture of heading tags (i.e. h2, h3), 
                        series of paragraph tags (i.e. p tags), 
                        unordered list (i.e. ul and li tag), 
                        tables containing rows and columns (i.e. table, th, td tags),

                        Such as the image on the HOME page (aboutme.png), it is displayed horizontally with the text on its left, this is using 'display: flex;' in the CSS file which tags to the .date (i.e. the CSS class for a div which contains the paragraph and the image that needed to be placed in a horizontal line). 
                    </p>
                    <p class="technical_aspects_t2_p3">
                        By applying the HTML tags correctly, it makes the website / pages to still representing the correct order, size and functions, even though the stylesheet is turned off; such as the image and paragraph just mentioned above, the 'width="450px"' is also included in the HTML tag for the image (img tag), it ensures that the size of the image would not be too big or too small when the HTML is not linked to the CSS file.

                        contains a navigation link of the page, which allows the users to go back to the top of the webpage, by utilising the 'a' tag (creating the 'top' as a link using the 'a' tag below the 'body' tag in the HTML file, then using another 'a' tag in the div container for the footer of the page to link to the top); 
                        also the footer contains information of the subject, assignment title, student name, id number and the institution (UTS), the text in the footer of the page is enclosed in the 'p' tags.

                        The layout of this website is vertical, which the users only need to scroll down if there is more contents, instead of scroll from left to right. 
                        All the elements (e.g. title, paragraph) are placed in a reading habit (from left to right), and spaces between each elements, so that the layout is cleaner, which also allows the contents to stand out better. 
                        This website are designed with simple HTML and CSS, the basic HTML tags (e.g. p , h1 tags) are used, which means that as the same HTML tags are used throughout the website, to achieve the same look. 
                        The CSS file is mainly used for improving the UI / UX design in this website, which provides the users a better user experience and can understand the contents of the website easily.

                        The font style used in the website is Times New Roman, and the font sizes are various throughout the website, such as the headings for each paragraph in the COMMENT page are using a larger size, whereas the text / paragraphs are using a large size.
                        This allows the appearance of the webpage be more readable for the users, and easier to found the content they need as the headings stand out in the webpage. 
                        Furthermore, some of the text are underlined (e.g. sub-headings) which can distinguish from the contents that under each topic.

                        The colors used throughout the website are mainly dark blue (background-color), white (navigation links), light-yellow(headings/title), as the color of the text is contradict to the background-color, it makes the contents stand out from the background-color, and easy to read.
                        The colors are kept consistent throughout the website, as the rgb numbers were copied and pasted in the CSS file, so that all colors keep the same looks. 
                        Also, some different colors used in the text (e.g. the blue text in the Footer paragraph) in order to make the specific text to stands out from the rest, so that the users can refer back to which part of the image is mentioned in the content.

                        The interactions in the website were created using CSS :hover selector. Such as the color of the navigation links changes when the mouse cursor move on the top of them (i.e. from white to yellow); 
                        the image of the webpage structure will be enlarged when the mouse cursor move on the top of it (i.e. transform: scale(1.5)), and a shadow effect is made using: box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5). Both interactions are used to provide feedbacks to the users when they are using the website, this could engage the users to read other webpages, and not get bored as they can feel their actions have been received, and image changing sizes instead of just plain text + image in the webpage.
